# seL4Doom

The work here is my attempt to make the PC game DOOM run on seL4.

The code is feature complete in the sense that I've implemented everything
that I had in mind when I started, but everything is pretty much untested 
at this point.

It should already be possible to play the game. So far, however, I've only 
tested the shareware WAD file, and I've only tried it with QEMU, so there
are probably a couple of things left that don't work yet.

I'll update this README file and/or the Wiki within the next couple of days...

Please let me know if you tried it but couldn't get it to run. Thanks!

If you try it out, make sure you also try the cheat codes "sel4" and "psu". :->
